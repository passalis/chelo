# CheLo Datasets

This page lists datasets included in **CheLo**. You can find more details in [CheLo's documentation](https://chelo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/datasets.html).

1. [Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality): Two datasets, related to red and white *vinho verde* wine samples, from the north of Portugal. The goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests.

2. [Coal Fired Power Plant Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ainalirham/coal-fired-power-plant-thermal-performance-dataset): This dataset contains data related to the thermal performance of coal-fired power plants, including various features, such as load factors, steam flow rates, and boiler efficiency, that are crucial for analyzing and predicting the thermal performance of power plants.

3. [Ames Mutagenicity Dataset](https://edgarsmdn.github.io/MLCE_book/02_kNN_QSPR.html): This dataset contains mutagenicity data for various chemicals tested on *Salmonella typhimurium* using the Ames test. It includes features that can be used to model and predict mutagenicity.

4. [Bioconcentration Factor (BCF) Dataset](https://edgarsmdn.github.io/MLCE_book/02_kNN_QSPR.html): This dataset contains chemical properties and experimental bioconcentration factor (BCF) values, useful for understanding the accumulation of chemicals in organisms.

5. [CSTR Dataset](https://edgarsmdn.github.io/MLCE_book/05_Hybrid_CSTR.html): This dataset provides time-series data of concentrations of three species (A, B, and X) in a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR). It is suitable for dynamic modeling of chemical processes.

6. [Vapor Pressure Dataset](https://edgarsmdn.github.io/MLCE_book/04_DNN_VLE.html): This dataset contains the phase envelope of various compounds, supporting research in thermodynamics and phase equilibrium.

7. [VLE Dataset](https://edgarsmdn.github.io/MLCE_book/04_DNN_VLE.html): This dataset focuses on vapor-liquid equilibria (VLE) of CO2, providing essential information for thermodynamic modeling and process design.
