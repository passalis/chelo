Datasets
===================================


This page lists datasets included in **CheLo**.

Wine Quality Dataset
---------------------
The `Wine Quality Dataset <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality>`_ contains two datasets related to red and white *vinho verde* wine samples, from the north of Portugal.
The goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests.
The dataset was introduced in :cite:p:`cortez2009modeling`.
Please refer to API reference for options supported by this dataset (:class:`chelo.datasets.WineQualityDataset`)

Coal Fired Power Plant Dataset
-------------------------------
The `Coal Fired Power Plant Dataset <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ainalirham/coal-fired-power-plant-thermal-performance-dataset>`_ contains data related to the thermal performance of coal-fired power plants.
This dataset includes various features, such as load factors, steam flow rates, and boiler efficiency, that are crucial for analyzing and predicting the thermal performance of power plants.
Please refer to the API reference for options supported by this dataset (:class:chelo.datasets.CoalFiredPlantDataset).
